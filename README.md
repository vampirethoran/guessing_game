# Guessing Game

A fun number guessing game written in Rust! Try to guess a number between 1 and 100.

From the [Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) with little little upgrades :)

## Prerequisites

Assuming you have forked this repo beforehand, to run this project, you need to have Rust installed on your system.

### Installing Rust

If you don't have Rust installed, you can install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This will install `rustc` (the Rust compiler), `cargo` (Rust's package manager), and other essential tools.

After installation, restart your terminal or run:
```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```
If you see a version numbver, you're good to go. 

Run the project:
```bash
cargo run
```
